# Module 1 Challenge - Analysis of Kickstarter Data through Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of refactoring the code was to make the code run faster so that in the future it could potentially be applied to a dataset that includes thousands if not more tickers of data. The ability to make the code run faster is important so that we can properly make the analysis on larger and larger sets of data without increasing the run-tiem cost by too much.

## Results

The results of refactoring the code were amazing. The previous runs took approximately 0.67 seconds whereas now they take 0.07 seconds, reducing the run-time of the code by almost 90%.
